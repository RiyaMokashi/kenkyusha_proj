Brief descriptions and OpenML links to the 16 data sets we used to evaluate average model performance.

## breast-w

The Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Original) data set. 699 data points, 9 feature columns, and 2 target classes. However, after cleaning out input rows with missing values encoded as '?', number of remaining data points dropped to 683. OpenML link [here](https://www.openml.org/d/15).

## diabetes

The Pima Indians diabetes data set. 768 data points, 8 feature columns, and 2 target classes. OpenML link [here](https://www.openml.org/d/37).

## iris

The classic iris data set. 150 data points, 4 feature columns, and 3 target classes. OpenML link [here](https://www.openml.org/d/61).

## isolet

The Isolated Letter Speech Recognition data set. 7797 data points, 617 feature columns, and 26 target classes. OpenML link [here](https://www.openml.org/d/300).

## MiceProtein

Expression levels for 77 types of mice proteins measured in the cerebral cortex of 8 classes of mice. 1080 data points, 81 features, and 8 target classes. However, after removing rows with '?' entries and dropping ignored features, number of data points dropped to 552, and the number of features dropped to 77. OpenML link [here](https://www.openml.org/d/40966). 

## mushroom

Descriptions of hypothetical samples of 23 different species of Agaricus and Lepiota mushrooms. 8124 data points, 22 features, and 2 target classes. However, after binarizing the features, which were all categorical, the number of features increased to a total of 118 one-hot features. Note that the `stalk-root` feature, which was the only feature that contained missing values, had the presence of missing values coded as another one-hot feature. OpenML link [here](https://www.openml.org/d/24).

## nursery

Data set derived from a hierarchical decision model used for ranking nursery school applications in the 1980s when there was excessive nursery school enrollment in Ljubljana, Slovenia. 12960 data points, 8 features, and 5 target classes. However, after binarizing the features, which were all categorical, the number of features increased to a total of 27 one-hot features. OpenML link [here](https://www.openml.org/d/26).

## optdigits

Handwritten digits for optical recognition, from UCI. 5620 data points, 64 feature columns, 10 target classes. OpenML link [here](https://www.openml.org/d/28).
