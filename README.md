## Data files

All data files used in this project may be found in the `./data` directory. The raw .csv data files downloaded from OpenML can be found in `./data/csv_raw`, while the [minimally] cleaned .csv data files can be found in `./data/csv_clean`. Descriptions for the 8 different data sets we used are below.

* **iris**

The classic iris data set. 150 data points, 4 feature columns, and 3 target classes. OpenML link [here](https://www.openml.org/d/61).

* **optdigits**

Handwritten digits for optical recognition, from UCI. 5620 data points, 64 feature columns, 10 target classes. OpenML link [here](https://www.openml.org/d/28).
